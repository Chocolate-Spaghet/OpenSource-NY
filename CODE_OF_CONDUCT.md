OSNY App is an open source tool that is built upon and improved by users and contributors from around the world. Through mutual support, hardwork, encouragement, and active discussion, we will be able to come together and grow as a community.

We are committed to keep our community safe, friendly, enjoyable, and welcoming.

<h3>Be considerate</h3>

You and others depend on changes made by yourself or other contributors. Any decision you take will affect other community members, so we expect you to think before you act and make decisions.

If you're contributing, make sure to give credit where it's due. It is also expected that you follow the guidelines.

If you encounter an issue or bug as a user, discuss the issue with detail and in a nice manner and refrain from using anger as many contributors spent a lot of time and hard work.

<h3>Be respectful</h3>

In any community, its members must feel comfortable and accepted. This is accomplished by respecting each other. In a disagreement, assume that people mean well.

We do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is inevitable, but understanding and respecting others will go a long way to make progress. Respecting other people and their contributions while assuming well-meaning motivation will result in motivation and productivity as members of the community will feel safe and comfortable.

We expect members of our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors, users and communities.

<h3>No harrassment</h3>

Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, racism, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. Additionally, trolling and spamming will be considered a form of harrassment, and thus not allowed.

Respect others if you want to be respected.
